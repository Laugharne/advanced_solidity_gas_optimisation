This course attempts to take the middle ground.
We will be covering theory, but it will be motivated by examples and will be actually stepping through the code and not just reading a bunch of formulas.
Gas costs depends on exactly four things during execution.

- One is the transaction data that was sent
- Two is the amount of memory that was used.
- Three is the state changes that took place.
- And four is the upgrades that were executed.

In my opinion, mastering Ethereum development requires three areas that you should be really good at.

- One is knowing what really good design patterns are like
- Two security,
- and three is optimizing gas costs.
