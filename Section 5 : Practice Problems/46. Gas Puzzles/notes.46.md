**Gas Puzzles**

1. Clone this repo: [GitHub - RareSkills/gas-puzzles: A sequence of smart contracts to practice gas optimization. These are used as practice assignments for RareSkills.io and the Udemy Gas Optimization Course](https://github.com/RareSkills/gas-puzzles)

2. Install with npm install

2. Optimize the contracts in the contracts folder by creating a folder inside with the path contracts/optimized_contracts/

3. Copy the contracts into the new folder

4. Prefix the contract names in the new folder with 'Optimized' e.g. contract ArraySum becomes OptimizedArraySum

5. Optimize the code until the test passes. To run the test do npx hardhat test tests/<contract_name>

6. Star the repo, more problems are being added!
